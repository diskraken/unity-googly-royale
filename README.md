**Description:**

- Created as a submission for #kenneyjam 2024 themed Connection,
- Despite having limited time my main goal was to include some extra challenges. I've managed to use 'googley-eyes' pack as the only texture import, didn't include any text during gameplay and restricted game input to mouse controls.

**Gameplay**

- Score points by selecting the same die face as your opponent, avoid getting score by selecting other faces - CPU players pursue their goals too ;)
- Keep an eye on your score - you don't want to get removed from the leadeboards too early!

**Controls**

- Use mouse to click on buttons and dice.
