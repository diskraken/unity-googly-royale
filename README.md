## Description

- Loose interpretation of Game Theory problem created as a submission for #kenneyjam2024, themed `Connection`.
- Despite having limited time my main goal was to include some additional extra challenges.
  - I've managed to use 'googley-eyes' pack as the only texture import,
  - didn't include any text during gameplay
  - and restricted game input to mouse controls only.

## Controls

- Use mouse to click on buttons and dice. 

## Gameplay

- You score point by selecting the same die face as your opponent, avoid getting score by selecting different faces
- Each round players on the edge are eliminated (both highest and lowest scores)
- Your goal is to stay in the game as long as possible
